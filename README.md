Project Introduction

Hello! This is a small-time landing page project about a QR company which specializes in offering their services to businesses and regular customers.

1. Design Direction
 - The layout is done through FlexBox, while trying to keep everything to a minimal aesthetic.
 - The nav-section shows some of the potential features, with an arrow for recommending new ones from users' side.
 - Login button is animated upon page load-in and also has hovering animations.
 - Our main content about the product showcase and information is animated, sliding from both sides into the middle.
 - Right below the main section, there is a button that reveals the rest of the company's features, which is also animated.
 - Kept the footer and feedback sections to a minimum as well, since I believe it is a good design and isn't over the top.
 - The project is responsive and adapts to mobile devices.

 2. JQuery implementation
  - The arrow next to the "Feature Recommendation" and under the company logo text is clickable with hover effects as well. It takes the user down to our feedback section.
  - The "Reveal features!" button is also clickable, showing the rest of the elements when clicked and hiding them when clicked again.
  - The "Submit" button at the feedback section also alerts the user, acknowledging their feedback is sent.

  3. Difficulties with the project
   - Being limited to only HTML & CSS, without the use of other libraries has left some ideas on the table. Such as a smooth transition for the reveal button for example.
   - Additional effects may have been used, where the features button has each row appear from the left or right for example.
   - Making the project responsive with media queries was also a bit of a challenge.
